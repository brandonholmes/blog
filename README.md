# A Blog Application

This is a trivial blog app, started with create-react-app.

Forked originally from github.com/lmucs/blog-starter-app, it originally works entirely within memory, so reloads blow everything away except for the first two mock articles.

This repo holds updates to (1) CSS, (2) authenticaion, and (3) a database.

# Deployment

This app is hosted [here](https://blog-d98df.web.app).
