# A Blog Application

This is a trivial blog app, started with create-react-app.

Forked originally from github.com/lmucs/blog-starter-app, it originally works entirely within memory, so reloads blow everything away except for the first two mock articles.

This repo holds updates with (1) better CSS and (2) a real back end, with authentication and a database.
